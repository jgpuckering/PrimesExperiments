# PrimesExperiments

This repository contains the results of various experiments I conducted in 2023-07 to investigate and improve upon the performance of perl solutions when computing prime numbers using the Sieve of Erostothenes algorithm.  

The trigger for this probject was the language-based speed contest started by Dave Plummer, a retired Microsoft engineer with a popular YouTube channel called [Dave's Garage](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesGarage).  Around Apr 2021 he uploaded solutions to this algorithm written by him in C#, python and C++ and published his results in a video.  He wanted to compare other languages, and so invited viewer to contribute.  One viewer took on the task of setting up a well organized GitHub repository and continuous integration framework, and within a few months there were 45 different languages and over 100 different implementations in the repo.

The code repo is (https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes).

Along the way, a web application was built to be able to view and filter results.  See (https://plummerssoftwarellc.github.io/PrimeView)

After watching a few videos comnparing languages, I came across one comparing perl and python.  Perl did not fare well, so I decided to look into the solutions and see what was going on and whether they could be improved.  This repository contains the results of my research.

A compilation of my notes and findings and conclusions can be found in AAA_README.txt.
